# Gatsby Starter Portfolio
> by LekoArts

Hi.

I'm LekoArts and I create starters for Gatsby.js. 
If you're a designer (and front-end developer) like me or a photographer you'll enjoy my Gatsby projects as those two groups are the target audience. You can bootstrap your personal project quick & easy with my minimalistic and fast starters.

Visit my [Gatsby Starter Portfolio Overview](https://gatsby-starter-portfolio.netlify.com/) to see my starters. Look at the previews, grab one starter and bootstrap your project or use it as a foundation for your personal project.

I hope you like my starters and create something awesome! To see some of my work you can visit my [website](https://www.lekoarts.de) or support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lekoarts) to get some neat rewards (4K images, project files, tutorial insights).
